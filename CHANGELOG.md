Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## Version Policy

aDNA tracks **two independent version numbers**:

| Track | File | Field | What it covers |
|-------|------|-------|---------------|
| **Governance** | `CLAUDE.md` | `version` (frontmatter) | Vault structure, agent protocol, safety rules, templates, skills |
| **Standard** | `what/docs/adna_standard.md` | Document title | Normative specification — triad structure, object schemas, FAIR metadata |

Both tracks use **Major.Minor** versioning (no patch level):

| Change type | Major bump | Minor bump |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| **Governance** | Breaking changes to vault structure, CLAUDE.md format, or frontmatter schema | New features, templates, skills, context topics, non-breaking additions, corrections |
| **Standard** | Breaking changes to triad structure, object schemas, or FAIR envelope format | New sections, clarifications, federation stubs, factual fixes |

**Canonical version location**: `CLAUDE.md` frontmatter `version` field (governance track). The migration system (`how/migrations/`) uses this field for pre-flight checks.

Changelog entries are organized by **governance version** (primary heading). Standard version changes are noted within entries when they coincide.

## [v5.3] — 2026-03-20

### Added
- `how/skills/skill_upstream_contribution.md` — agentic upstream contribution protocol
- Upstream Contribution Awareness section in `CLAUDE.md`
- Upstream Contribution Awareness section in root `AGENTS.md`
- Contributing section in `README.md`

### Changed
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` revised — Agent Contribution Mode replaces static PR-Context pattern; organic discovery over structured proposals
- `CLAUDE.md` version bump: `5.2` → `5.3`
- Code of Conduct reference updated to forward-looking note (pending `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`)

### Removed
- Empty `community/proposals/` directory (superseded by agentic backlog pattern)
- Empty `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory (standard GitHub issues sufficient for now)
